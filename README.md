# Pool Game
One of my University project where we had to create a pool game. There were 3 stages in this project where we had to implement different design patterns.   
After end of each stage we were given other's people code where we had to add more function using more design pattern.  
This was the final product that was formed. (All of this code is not written by me)   

### Dependencies
1) C++ 11  
2) QT 5.9
